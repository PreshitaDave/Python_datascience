There is no prior programming experience required and the book is loved by liberal arts majors and geeks alike. If you've ever spent hours renaming files or updating hundreds of spreadsheet cells, you know how tedious tasks like these can be. But what if you could have your computer do them for you? In this fully revised second edition of the best-selling classic Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, you'll learn how to use Python to write programs that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand--no prior programming experience required. You'll learn the basics of Python and explore Python's rich library of modules for performing specific tasks, like scraping data off websites, reading PDF and Word documents, and automating clicking and typing tasks. The second edition of this international fan favorite includes a brand-new chapter on input validation, as well as tutorials on automating Gmail and Google Sheets, plus tips on automatically updating CSV files. You'll learn how to create programs that effortlessly perform useful feats of automation to: • Search for text in a file or across multiple files • Create, update, move, and rename files and folders • Search the Web and download online content • Update and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any size • Split, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFs • Send email responses and text notifications • Fill out online forms Step-by-step instructions walk you through each program, and updated practice projects at the end of each chapter challenge you to improve those programs and use your newfound skills to automate similar tasks. Don't spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do. Even if you've never written a line of code, you can make your computer do the grunt work.

However, Python has unique strengths, charms, and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of them. Effective Python will help you harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling Effective C++, Brett Slatkin brings together 53 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers. Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve. Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes: * Algorithms * Objects * Concurrency * Collaboration * Built-in modules * Production techniques * And more Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using Effective Python, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense.""--[Source inconnue].","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780134034287'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0134034287'}]",False,True,227,BOOK,,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Python&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&dq=Python&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Effective_Python.html?hl=&id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"Effective Python will help students harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.",Pearson Education,['Computers'],,,,,,
